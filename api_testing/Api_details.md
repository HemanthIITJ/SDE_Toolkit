## 1. Introduction to API Testing

API testing involves validating the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of APIs. Unlike UI testing, API testing focuses on the business logic, data responses, and backend processes of an application. It is performed by sending requests to API endpoints and analyzing the responses. API testing is essential in microservices architectures, RESTful services, SOAP-based services, and GraphQL APIs, ensuring seamless communication between components.

The key objectives of API testing include:
- Verifying correct API behavior for valid and invalid inputs.
- Ensuring performance under varying loads.
- Validating security against potential vulnerabilities.
- Confirming compliance with API specifications (e.g., OpenAPI, Swagger).

Below, we explore the different types of API testing in detail, with a focus on their purpose, methodology, and practical applications.

#### Key Focus Areas
- Input validation and output accuracy.
- Error handling for invalid inputs.
- Compliance with API specifications (e.g., RESTful principles, JSON schema).

#### Steps for Functional Testing
1. **Understand API Requirements**: Review API documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI specs) to identify expected behavior.
2. **Identify Test Scenarios**: Create test cases for each endpoint, covering positive, negative, and edge cases.
3. **Prepare Test Data**: Use valid, invalid, and boundary data to test the API.
4. **Execute Tests**: Send requests (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and capture responses.
5. **Validate Responses**: Compare actual responses with expected responses, checking status codes, headers, and body content.
6. **Automate Tests**: Use tools to automate repetitive functional tests.

#### Example
For an API endpoint `/users/{id}` (GET):
- **Test Case 1 (Positive)**: Send GET request with valid `id` → Expect status code `200` and user data in JSON.
- **Test Case 2 (Negative)**: Send GET request with invalid `id` → Expect status code `404` and error message.
- **Test Case 3 (Edge)**: Send GET request with `id = 0` → Validate behavior for boundary values.
