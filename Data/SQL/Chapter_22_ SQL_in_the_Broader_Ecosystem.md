# Chapter 22 – SQL in the Broader Ecosystem  

SQL doesn’t exist in isolation—it integrates with diverse data stores, application layers, analytics platforms, and cloud services. This chapter surveys how SQL fits into modern architectures and workflows.

## 22.1 SQL vs. NoSQL Databases: Understanding the Trade‑offs  

| Aspect             | SQL (Relational)                                | NoSQL (Non‑Relational)                |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Data Model         | Fixed schema, tables with rows & columns        | Document, key‑value, wide‑column, graph |
| Schema Evolution   | ALTER TABLE; migrations                          | Flexible, schema‑on‑read               |
| Transactions       | ACID guarantees                                  | Varies: eventual consistency, limited ACID (e.g., MongoDB 4.x) |
| Query Language     | Powerful declarative SQL + joins, aggregates    | API‑specific queries or proprietary DSL |
| Scalability        | Vertical scaling; sharding/partitioning support | Horizontal scaling native              |
| Use Cases          | OLTP, financials, strong consistency             | High‑velocity writes, flexible models, graphs, caching |

Trade‑off summary:
- Choose **SQL** when strict consistency, complex joins, and mature tooling matter.
- Choose **NoSQL** when flexible schemas, massive scale-out, or specialized workloads (e.g., full-text, graph traversals) dominate.
- **Polyglot persistence** often combines both: relational for core transactions; NoSQL for logging, caching, or user profiles.

## 22.2 Connecting to Databases from Application Code  

### Common APIs and Drivers  
- **JDBC (Java)**: Standard interface; driver manager, connection pooling (HikariCP, C3P0).  
- **ODBC (C/C++/.NET)**: Cross‑platform C API; DSN‑based connections.  
- **ADO.NET (C#)**: `SqlConnection`, `SqlCommand`, support for async I/O.  
- **PDO (PHP)**, **DBI (Perl)**, **DBI (Ruby)**: Language‑specific abstractions.  
- **node-postgres**, **Sequelize**, **Django ORM** connectors.

### Best Practices  
- Use **connection pools** to reuse sockets and statements.  
- Always employ **parameterized** queries or **prepared statements** to prevent SQL injection and improve plan caching.  
- Handle errors and implement **retry logic** for transient failures.  
- Close or release connections promptly to avoid exhaustion.

## 22.3 Object‑Relational Mapping (ORM) Tools and SQL  

| Pattern            | Description                                         |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Active Record      | Models encapsulate both data + behavior (Rails)     |
| Data Mapper        | Separate in‑memory objects from persistence logic (Hibernate) |

### Advantages  
- Speeds development by mapping tables to classes.  
- Automates CRUD, migrations, and associations.  
- Provides abstraction over vendor SQL dialects.

### Pitfalls  
- **N+1 Query Problem**: Lazy‑loaded associations causing many round‑trips.  
- **Leaky Abstractions**: Complex queries may require dropping to raw SQL.  
- Over‑fetching or under‑fetching data if object graph not tuned.

### Tips  
- Profile SQL generated by the ORM; add explicit **eager‑load** clauses (`JOIN FETCH`, `.Include()`).  
- Use **query builders** or **raw SQL** for performance‑critical paths.  
- Version‑control your ORM mappings and migrations alongside code.

## 22.4 Data Warehousing and ETL Processes with SQL  

### Warehouse Architectures  
- **Star Schema**: Fact tables + dimension tables.  
- **Snowflake Schema**: Normalized dimensions.

### ETL/ELT Patterns  
1. **Extract**: Pull from OLTP or external sources  
2. **Transform**:  
   - SQL‑based transformations in staging tables  
   - Window functions for deduplication, surrogate key generation  
3. **Load**: Insert into fact/dimension tables (bulk loads, `COPY`, `BULK INSERT`)

### Tools & Practices  
- **Batch Orchestration**: Apache Airflow, AWS Glue, SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).  
- **Incremental Loads**: Change data capture (CDC), high‑watermark timestamps.  
- **Data Validation**: Row counts, checksums, `CHECK` constraints on staging tables.  
- **Performance**: Partitioning, cluster keys, and sort keys for large datasets.

## 22.5 Business Intelligence and Reporting with SQL  

### Semantic Layers & Cubes  
- Build **views** or **materialized views** as semantic tables (e.g., `monthly_revenue`).  
- Use **OLAP cubes** (SQL Server Analysis Services, Oracle OLAP) for multi‑dimensional reporting.

### BI Tools Integration  
- **Tableau**, **Power BI**, **Looker**, **Qlik** connect via ODBC/JDBC or native connectors.  
- Leverage **custom SQL** or **prebuilt views** for consistent metrics.  
- Use **parameterized dashboards** to pass filters (regions, dates).

### Analytical Techniques  
- Leverage window functions for running totals and ranks.  
- Use pivot/unpivot operations for cross‑tab reports.  
- Combine SQL with R/Python via database extensions (e.g., PL/Python, SQL Server Machine Learning Services).

## 22.6 Cloud Databases and SQL (Managed Services)  

| Service            | Type                | Key Features                                      |
|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| AWS RDS/Aurora     | Relational MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server | Automated backups, read replicas, multi‑AZ          |
| Google Cloud SQL   | MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server | Serverless options, automatic patching              |
| Azure SQL Database | Managed SQL Server  | DTU/vCore models, Hyperscale tier                  |
| AWS Redshift       | Columnar Data Warehouse | Massive parallel processing, COPY from S3          |
| Google BigQuery    | Serverless Data Warehouse | SQL standard, on‑demand or flat‑rate pricing       |
| Cloud Spanner      | Globally distributed relational | Horizontal scaling, strongly consistent ACID       |

### Considerations  
- **Scalability**: Vertical vs horizontal vs serverless.  
- **High‑Availability**: Multi‑AZ/multi‑region replication and failover.  
- **Security & Compliance**: VPC integration, IAM roles, encryption at rest/in transit.  
- **Cost Model**: Provisioned vs on‑demand, storage vs compute separation.  
- **Feature Parity**: Some managed offerings limit certain extensions, procedural languages, or full‑text support.
