## **Chapter 2: Fundamental Data Retrieval (SELECT)**

This chapter delves into the foundational Structured Query Language (SQL) statement for retrieving data from a database: the `SELECT` statement. Mastery of its components is critical for any interaction involving data extraction.

### **2.1 The SELECT Statement: Querying Data**

**Concept:**
The `SELECT` statement is the primary mechanism in SQL used to query and retrieve data from one or more database tables or views. It forms the basis of most data retrieval operations. At its core, it specifies *what* data to retrieve and *from where*.

**Fundamental Structure:**
The minimal syntactical structure of a query involves specifying the columns to be selected and the table from which to retrieve them.

```sql
SELECT column_list
FROM table_name;
```

-   `SELECT`: Keyword initiating the data retrieval operation.
-   `column_list`: Specifies the columns (or expressions based on columns) to be returned in the result set.
-   `FROM`: Keyword indicating the source of the data.
-   `table_name`: The specific table (or view, or other data source) from which data is being queried.

**Execution Flow (Conceptual):**
While SQL is declarative (you specify *what* you want, not *how* to get it), the database engine typically first identifies the data source (`FROM`) and then extracts the specified columns (`SELECT`). Subsequent clauses (discussed in later chapters) refine this process (e.g., filtering, sorting).

### **2.2 The FROM Clause: Specifying the Source Table**

**Concept:**
The `FROM` clause is mandatory in any standard `SELECT` statement that retrieves data from persistent storage. It explicitly declares the table(s) or other data source(s) containing the data relevant to the query.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

-   `table_name`: The identifier for the database table. This could also be a view, a derived table (subquery), or other table-like objects depending on the specific database system.

**Key Points:**
-   A query must have a `FROM` clause if it accesses data stored within tables.
-   The clause can specify a single table or multiple tables (typically involving `JOIN` operations, covered later).
-   Database systems use the `FROM` clause to locate the data storage structure and prepare for data access.

**Example:**
To indicate that data retrieval should occur from a table named `Employees`:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, first_name
FROM Employees;
```

### **2.3 Selecting Specific Columns**

**Concept:**
Instead of retrieving all data from a table, you can specify exactly which columns are needed in the result set. This is achieved by listing the desired column names, separated by commas, directly after the `SELECT` keyword.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column_name1, column_name2, column_nameN
FROM table_name;
```

**Benefits:**
-   **Efficiency:** Reduces the amount of data transferred over the network and processed by the client application.
-   **Clarity:** The query explicitly states the data points of interest.
-   **Security/Privacy:** Limits exposure of potentially sensitive data stored in other columns.

**Example:**
To retrieve only the employee ID, first name, and salary from the `Employees` table:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, first_name, salary
FROM Employees;
```

**Result Set Structure:**
The output will contain only the specified columns, typically in the order listed in the `SELECT` clause.

### **2.4 Selecting All Columns (*)**

**Concept:**
SQL provides a wildcard character, the asterisk (`*`), as a shorthand to select all columns defined in the table(s) specified in the `FROM` clause.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table_name;
```

**Behavior:**
The database system replaces the `*` with the full list of columns present in `table_name` at the time of query execution, in the order they were defined in the table schema.

**Example:**
To retrieve all columns from the `Departments` table:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Departments;
```

**Caution and Best Practices:**
-   **Avoid in Production Code:** Using `SELECT *` in application code is strongly discouraged.
    -   **Performance:** It often retrieves more data than necessary, increasing network I/O and memory consumption.
    -   **Fragility:** If the underlying table schema changes (columns added, removed, or reordered), the application consuming the data might break if it expects a specific column order or set of columns.
-   **Use Cases:** `SELECT *` is acceptable and useful for:
    -   Ad-hoc querying and data exploration during development or analysis.
    -   Debugging purposes.
    -   Queries where the explicit intent *is* to retrieve all columns regardless of future schema changes (rare, requires careful consideration).

### **2.5 Using Aliases for Columns and Tables (AS)**

**Concept:**
Aliases provide temporary, alternative names for columns or tables within the scope of a single query. They enhance readability, manage naming conflicts, and provide meaningful names for derived columns (e.g., calculations).

**Column Aliases:**
-   **Purpose:** To rename columns in the output result set. Useful for calculated fields or when original column names are cryptic or overly long.
-   **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    -- Using the AS keyword (recommended for clarity)
    SELECT column_name AS alias_name, another_column AS "Another Name"
    FROM table_name;

    -- Omitting the AS keyword (supported by many systems)
    SELECT column_name alias_name, calculation complex_calc_result
    FROM table_name;
    ```
    -   If the alias contains spaces, special characters, or matches a keyword, it must typically be enclosed in double quotes (`" "`) or square brackets (`[ ]`), depending on the SQL dialect.

**Table Aliases:**
-   **Purpose:** To shorten table names in queries involving multiple tables (joins) or self-referencing tables, improving query conciseness and readability.
-   **Syntax:**
    ```sql
    -- Using the AS keyword
    SELECT e.employee_id, d.department_name
    FROM Employees AS e
    JOIN Departments AS d ON e.department_id = d.department_id; -- JOIN covered later

    -- Omitting the AS keyword
    SELECT e.employee_id, d.department_name
    FROM Employees e
    JOIN Departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;
    ```
-   Once a table alias is defined in the `FROM` clause, it *must* be used to qualify column names from that table throughout the rest of the query (e.g., `e.employee_id` instead of `Employees.employee_id`).

**Example (Column and Table Aliases):**

```sql
SELECT
    e.employee_id AS "Employee ID",
    e.first_name || ' ' || e.last_name AS "Full Name", -- String concatenation (see 2.7)
    e.salary * 1.1 AS "Projected Salary (10% Increase)" -- Calculation (see 2.6)
FROM
    Employees AS e;
```

### **2.6 Performing Basic Calculations in SELECT**

**Concept:**
The `SELECT` list is not limited to retrieving raw column data. It can include expressions that perform calculations using column values, literals, and standard arithmetic operators.

**Common Operators:**
-   `+` (Addition)
-   `-` (Subtraction)
-   `*` (Multiplication)
-   `/` (Division)
-   `%` (Modulo - remainder of division, operator symbol may vary by SQL dialect)

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT
    column1,
    column2,
    column1 + 5 AS adjusted_value,
    column2 * column3 AS product_value,
    (column4 / column5) * 100 AS percentage_value
FROM
    table_name;
```

**Key Considerations:**
-   **Aliases:** Always assign a meaningful alias (using `AS`) to calculated columns for clarity in the result set. Without an alias, the database system often assigns a default, non-intuitive name.
-   **Data Types:** Be mindful of implicit data type conversions and potential precision loss (e.g., integer division might truncate decimals). Explicit casting might be necessary (`CAST` or `CONVERT` functions).
-   **Operator Precedence:** Standard mathematical precedence rules apply (multiplication/division before addition/subtraction). Use parentheses `()` to enforce a specific order of operations if needed.
-   **NULL Propagation:** Calculations involving `NULL` typically result in `NULL` (e.g., `5 + NULL` yields `NULL`). This behavior needs to be understood and handled appropriately (see Section 2.8).

**Example:**
Calculate the annual salary and a potential bonus for employees.

```sql
SELECT
    employee_id,
    salary AS monthly_salary,
    salary * 12 AS annual_salary,
    (salary * 12) * 0.05 AS potential_bonus -- 5% bonus calculation
FROM
    Employees;
```

### **2.7 Concatenating String Values**

**Concept:**
Concatenation is the operation of joining two or more character strings end-to-end. In SQL, this is commonly used to combine values from different columns (e.g., first name and last name) into a single, meaningful string in the result set.

**Standard SQL Operator:**
-   The standard SQL operator for string concatenation is `||` (double pipe).

**Syntax (Standard):**

```sql
SELECT
    column1,
    column2,
    column1 || ' ' || column2 AS concatenated_string
FROM
    table_name;
```
-   In this example, `column1` and `column2` (presumably string types) are joined with a literal space `' '` in between.

**Common Database-Specific Variations:**
-   **SQL Server:** Uses the `+` operator for string concatenation (requires careful handling if numeric types might be involved, as `+` also means addition). The `CONCAT()` function is generally safer.
-   **MySQL:** Supports both `||` (if SQL mode includes `PIPES_AS_CONCAT`) and the `CONCAT()` function.
-   **PostgreSQL:** Primarily uses `||`. Also has `CONCAT()`.
-   **Oracle:** Primarily uses `||`. Also has `CONCAT()` (which typically takes only two arguments).

**Using the `CONCAT()` Function (Commonly Available):**
Most database systems provide a `CONCAT()` function as a more explicit alternative or for compatibility.

**Syntax (Generic `CONCAT` function):**

```sql
SELECT
    CONCAT(column1, ' ', column2, ' - ', column3) AS combined_info
FROM
    table_name;
```
-   The exact behavior and number of arguments supported by `CONCAT()` can vary slightly between database systems.

**Key Considerations:**
-   **Aliases:** Always use aliases (`AS`) for concatenated strings to provide meaningful column names in the output.
-   **Data Types:** Ensure the columns being concatenated are character string types (e.g., `VARCHAR`, `CHAR`, `TEXT`). Implicit conversion might occur, but explicit casting (`CAST` or `CONVERT`) is often safer if dealing with non-string types.
-   **NULL Handling:** If any part of the concatenation operation involves a `NULL` value, the result is typically `NULL` when using the `||` operator. The behavior of `CONCAT()` functions with `NULL` can vary (some treat NULL as an empty string, others propagate the NULL). Use `COALESCE` or similar functions (see Section 2.8) to handle potential `NULL` values within the strings being concatenated if a different behavior is desired.

**Example:**
Create a full name string from `first_name` and `last_name` columns in the `Employees` table.

```sql
-- Using standard || operator
SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name,
    first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name
FROM
    Employees;

-- Using a generic CONCAT function (example)
SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name,
    CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
FROM
    Employees;
```

### **2.8 Handling NULL Values in Output**

**Concept:**
`NULL` is a special marker in SQL used to indicate the absence of a value or an unknown value. It is not the same as zero (`0`), an empty string (`''`), or a space (`' '`). When `NULL` values appear in raw query output, they can be ambiguous or undesirable for presentation or further processing. SQL provides functions to substitute `NULL` values with a specified default value within the result set.

**Representation in Output:**
Database query tools often display `NULL` as `(NULL)`, `[NULL]`, `null`, or simply as an empty space in the output grid, depending on the tool's configuration.

**Need for Handling:**
-   **Presentation:** Displaying a user-friendly default (e.g., "N/A", "Not Provided", `0`) instead of `NULL`.
-   **Calculations:** As mentioned (Section 2.6), calculations involving `NULL` usually result in `NULL`. Substituting `NULL` with a default (like `0` for numeric calculations) might be necessary.
-   **Concatenation:** As mentioned (Section 2.7), concatenating with `NULL` often results in `NULL`. Substituting `NULL` with an empty string (`''`) might be needed.
-   **Application Logic:** Downstream applications might not handle `NULL` gracefully, requiring non-null values.

**Standard SQL Function: `COALESCE`**
-   `COALESCE(expression1, expression2, ..., expressionN)`: Returns the first non-NULL expression in the argument list.
-   This is the most standard and versatile function across different SQL database systems.

**Syntax using `COALESCE`:**

```sql
SELECT
    column1,
    COALESCE(nullable_column, 'Default Value') AS column_with_default,
    COALESCE(numeric_nullable_column, 0) AS numeric_with_default
FROM
    table_name;
```
-   If `nullable_column` is `NULL`, the expression returns `'Default Value'`. Otherwise, it returns the value of `nullable_column`.
-   If `numeric_nullable_column` is `NULL`, the expression returns `0`. Otherwise, it returns the value of `numeric_nullable_column`.

**Common Database-Specific Functions:**
-   **SQL Server:** `ISNULL(check_expression, replacement_value)` - Similar to `COALESCE` but takes only two arguments.
-   **Oracle:** `NVL(expression1, expression2)` - Similar to `ISNULL`. Oracle also supports `NVL2` and `COALESCE`.
-   **MySQL:** `IFNULL(expression1, expression2)` - Similar to `ISNULL`. MySQL also supports `COALESCE`.

**Best Practice:**
Prefer `COALESCE` for better portability across different database systems, unless specific performance characteristics or functionalities of dialect-specific functions are required.

**Example:**
Display employee commission percentages, showing `0.0` if the commission value is `NULL`. Also, create a contact description using the `phone_number`, defaulting to 'No Phone Provided' if it's `NULL`.

```sql
SELECT
    employee_id,
    salary,
    commission_pct,
    COALESCE(commission_pct, 0.0) AS effective_commission_pct,
    phone_number,
    COALESCE(phone_number, 'No Phone Provided') AS contact_info
FROM
    Employees;
```

### **2.9 Retrieving Unique Rows (DISTINCT)**

**Concept:**
The `DISTINCT` keyword is used in a `SELECT` statement to eliminate duplicate rows from the result set. It ensures that every row returned is unique based on the combination of values across *all* selected columns.

**Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name;
```

-   `DISTINCT` must appear immediately after the `SELECT` keyword.

**Behavior:**
-   The database system executes the query as if `DISTINCT` were not present.
-   It then examines the intermediate result set and removes any rows that are exact duplicates of other rows already included.
-   Two rows are considered duplicates if the values in *all* corresponding columns specified in the `SELECT DISTINCT` list are identical. `NULL` values are typically treated as equal to other `NULL` values for the purpose of `DISTINCT`.

**Example:**
Retrieve the unique list of Department IDs that have employees assigned to them from the `Employees` table.

```sql
-- Without DISTINCT (may contain duplicates if multiple employees are in the same department)
SELECT department_id
FROM Employees;

-- With DISTINCT (returns each department_id only once, even if multiple employees belong to it)
SELECT DISTINCT department_id
FROM Employees;
```

**Applying `DISTINCT` to Multiple Columns:**
`DISTINCT` operates on the entire row defined by the selected columns.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department_id, job_id
FROM Employees;
```
-   This query returns unique combinations of `department_id` and `job_id`. A row with `(department_id=10, job_id='CLERK')` is considered different from `(department_id=10, job_id='MANAGER')`. Duplicate rows where *both* `department_id` and `job_id` are the same will be eliminated.

**Key Considerations:**
-   **Placement:** `DISTINCT` applies to all columns listed in the `SELECT` clause. It cannot be applied selectively to individual columns within the same `SELECT` list.
-   **Performance:** Using `DISTINCT` often requires the database system to perform a sort or hashing operation on the intermediate result set to identify duplicates, which can incur performance overhead, especially on large datasets. Consider if `DISTINCT` is truly necessary or if alternative query structures (like `GROUP BY`, covered later) might be more appropriate or efficient.
-   **`NULL` Handling:** Most database systems treat `NULL` values as equal when evaluating `DISTINCT`. A row containing `NULL` in a column will be considered a duplicate of another row with `NULL` in the same column (assuming other columns also match).
